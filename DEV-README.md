# cubeOS's Developer Readme

## Don't Hesitate to Open an Issue
There are a lot of hard things to be done in developing cubeOS, but that doesn't mean that small bugs or minor changes don't also need to be fixed. Any and every enhancement request or bug report is extremely useful. The issue list should act as a sort of todo list for developers.

## Joining
GitHub doesn't have a private messaging system, so there are only two main means of contacting me (SashaCrofter) or other developers: the [issue](http://github.com/cubeOS/cubeOS-alpha/issues/) form, and the Jabber chatroom, `cubeos@conference.jabber.org`. For the former, please tag your request with `dev add request`, if you can. For the latter, create a Jabber account at [Jabber's server](https://register.jabber.org/), and use a chat client, such as [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/), to join the chatroom *cubeos* on the server *conference.jabber.org* using your Jabber account. (If you have a Jabber account on the jabber.org server, you don't need to make a new one.)
