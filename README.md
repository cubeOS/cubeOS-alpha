The DERPKERN cubeOS (in progress) for DCPU-16 (1.7)

It is intended to be a UNIX-like operating system with only an extensive math library and bare essentials included in the kernal. Bare essentials tools are not to be mistaken for lack of a full operating system, however. In its finished state, it should include an advanced hardware driver capable of detecting and utilizing hardware at its disposal. Furthermore, data manipulation with it will be simple, using an included filesystem and data manager (for copies, moves, clears, and block word manipulations. It is intended to be used as a platform for onboard navigation management and data crunching, and hopefully other automated processes, as documentation for other hardware is released.
