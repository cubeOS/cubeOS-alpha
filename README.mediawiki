'''cubeOS''' is a work-in-progress operating system for 0x10<sup>c</sup>'s emulated 16-bit computer, the DCPU-16. It is a UNIX-inspired, command line interface (CLI) driven, and powerful opating system, with the intent to be included on every ship that needs fast and powerful tools to quickly solve mathematical problems, including those posed by navigation, trading, warfare, and other number-crunching activities.

Besides its UNIX-like shell, ''dash'', its most obvious feature will be an included math library.
