<h1>cubeOS</h1>

<p><b>cubeOS</b> is a work-in-progress operating system for 0x10<sup>c</sup>'s emulated 16-bit computer, the DCPU-16. It is a UNIX-inspired, command line interface (CLI) driven, and powerful opating system, with the intent to be included on every ship that needs fast and powerful tools to quickly solve mathematical problems, including those posed by navigation, trading, warfare, and other number-crunching activities.</p>

<p>Package-writing should be trivial for the cubeOS, and most assembly programs will need little or no change, (besides being relocatable,) in order to be included (and not necessarily at boot time) and invoked by shell.</p>

<h1>current version</h1>

<p>cubeOS alpha is currently, (and confusingly,) in pre-alpha state.</p>
